appname=Seafile
appdescription=Seafile is a full private file synchronization and collaboration for teams. If you are in a small team with a few people, you can create a group in Seafile and invite other team members. Team members can then maintain file libraries together. You may collaborate around the files online. With file synchronization, it's also easy to work on a set of files together. Seafile works on each OS platform and delivers an intelligent client that syncs data. It`s like dropbox, but private!
