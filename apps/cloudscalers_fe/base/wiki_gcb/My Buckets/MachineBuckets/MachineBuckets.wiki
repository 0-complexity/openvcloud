h2. Machine Buckets

Machine Buckets are ultra fast virtual machines, running at enterprise level SSD speeds, delivering a very high IO performance. Machine Buckets are delivered with a complete toolset of powerful functions that provide control and flexibility: start, stop, clone, snapshot, rollback, export and monitor machines.

Machine Buckets are delivered with a basic package of CPU, Memory and Storage. Bandwidth is unlimited as long as fair use applies. You can add to your basic package additional primary storage and archive/backup storage. You can choose the datacenter location of your Machine Bucket and optionally replicate it to one or more datacenters for failover purposes.
