Unlike other clouds, OpenvCloud puts every virtual machine behind a private firewall.

To have access to your virtual machine you can create a VPN connection (see other tutorials) or configure a

port forwarding (means forward a port from your private firewall to the port on your virtual machine).

Here we will choose for the later option.

In order to configure the port forwarding, click on Port Forwards tab:

Click the Add button, and specify that you want to forward port 3022 to you port 22 on your virtual machine:

As a result you will see the below:

We will now use an ssh client to connect to the virtual machine e.g. putty

Your ip address is the one mentioned above in “Public IP” in your portforwards.

Congrats, you are on your machine.



h2. Tip 1
To change password of root user do `sudo passwd root`

h2. Tip 2
To connect over ssh you always need to login as cloudscalers and then use `sudo -s` to get root access.

You can now deploy whatever apps & through port forwarding (like done above) give access to your apps.
