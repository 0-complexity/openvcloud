h2. Storage Buckets

Few truly distributed storage systems are available today. And the existing ones focus on 1 use case: small files versus big, data base records,
volumes, ...
Often, the distributed storage systems are slow, complex, don't have a unified namespace, are hard to use in a cloud context and have a TCO
that remains quite high.
h4. Storage Buckets bring a file system that fits all use cases and much more:

* A distributed file system with unified namespace
* Ultra ultra-scalable
* Scalable for trillions of files
* Ultra reliable & redundant
* Improved Power & Disk Efficient (even when redundant configuration)
* Dedupe, compression, erasure coding, ...
* Performance good enough for 99% of use cases
* +200 MB/Sec for large files
* +20.000 IOPS for volume based access
* Very good TCO
* Hardware independent, its software doing the job

The storage buckets are used with an intuitive REST API.
