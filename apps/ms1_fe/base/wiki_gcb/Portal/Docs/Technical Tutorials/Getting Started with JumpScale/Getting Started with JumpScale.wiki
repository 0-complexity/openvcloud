h1. Getting Started with JumpScale

h2. To Install JSBOX

(Tested on 13.10 & 14.04 64 bit. Also works on equavelant mint distro 64 bit)

h3. Update your apt repository & make sure some basic requirements are met
In your terminal:
{{code: template:shell
apt-get update
#apt-get upgrade
apt-get install mercurial ssh mc curl python-pip -y
}}

h3. Install the sandbox

{{code: template:shell
curl http://install.jumpscale.org:85/cmds/jsbox_stable.sh > /tmp/init.sh;sh /tmp/init.sh
source /opt/jsbox/activate
}}

This installs JumpScale and puts it in sandboxed mode.


h3. To be able to use all tools from sandbox:
{{code:
echo "export JSBASE=/opt/jsbox
export PATH=/opt/jsbox/bin:/opt/jsbox/tools:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
}}


h3. Update the jpackage metadata

{{code: template:shell
jpackage mdupdate
}}

Now you'll have the automation framework JumpScale installed and sandboxed and jpackages ready to use!
