appfeature1=* Brand new UI: Our updated user interface makes finding and working with your customer information easier than ever. We've combined three navigation bars into a single new one, so you’ll spend less time navigating and more time working productively.
appfeature2=* More Powerful Search: Find the information you need faster with full text search. In just a few keystrokes you'll see top results. It's quick, it's incredibly useful, and it even searches custom modules and fields.
appfeature3=* Better Calendar: Create recurring meetings and calls and change their duration with the easy new drag and drop calendar interface. Send automated email reminders before your meetings to boost attendance. Invite contacts outside of Sugar to your meetings. View meeting details in other calendars with the new iCal integration. 
appfeature4=* Faster Performance: Sugar is faster than ever. Our engineers tell us it's due to "client-side resource caching,” "reduced 'getImage' load times,” and "faster listview queries.” What it means if you're not a software developer (or even if you are) is noticeably quicker page loads and shorter response times.
