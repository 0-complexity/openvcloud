## OpenvCloud Functional Tests

Please only put **internal** documentation on this page.

There are two types of functional tests, for each of them there is a subdirectory:

- [Tests designed to run on a physical compute node](./docs/compute_node_hosted/compute_node_hosted.md)


- [Tests designed to run on ovc_master](./docs/ovc_master_hosted/ovc_master_hosted.md)
