h2. Storage Buckets

Few truly distributed storage systems are available today. Often, the distributed storage systems are slow, complex, don't have a unified namespace, are hard to use in a cloud context and have a TCO that remains quite high.

vScalers presents Storage Buckets, providing you you with a secure, distributed storage solution that is unique in its kind. The storage buckets are used with an S3 API. Check out the [API Documentation|ApiDocs].

{{html:
	<div ng-controller="StorageController">
	    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" ng-cloak>
	    <tr>
	      <th>Bucket</th>
	      <th>Access Key</th>
	      <th>Size</th>
	    </tr>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr ng-repeat="storage in storages">
	        <td><a href="{[ storage.url ]}">{[ storage.url ]}</a> </td>
	        <td>{[ storage.accesskey ]}</td>
	        <td>{[ storage.size ]}</td>
	      </tr>
	    </tbody>
	  </table>
