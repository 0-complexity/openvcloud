h2. Welcome to your OpenvCloud Cloud Space!

Before you start, maybe some things that are good to know:
The Cloud Space provides access to different Cloud Decks:

		* Machine Deck: Virtual Machines creation and management via the web portal or API.

The Cloud Space is protected by the Defense Shield, your personal firewall that handles all incoming and outgoing traffic for your Cloud Space, your routing, port fowards and firewall settings.

h2. Cloud Space

	*# Go to Billing to view your balance and upload credit
	*# Optionally Go to Cloud Space Settings to provide access to other registered users in the OpenvCloud cloud.
	*# Optionally create an additional Cloud Space, allowing you to divide your resources into 2 private networks, managed fron the same portal!

	h2. Cloud Credits

	The Cloud Space handles no commitments or built-in limits to the number of services you can create, but uses a minimal credit balance policy. Your created services or actions taken on active services should be able to last for at least 4 days with your remaining credit. For example, you have a credit balance of 5 USD, that will allow you to create either several small Linux virtual machines up to one 4GB Linux package.
