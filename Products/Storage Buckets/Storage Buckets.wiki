h2. Storage Buckets
h3. Description

Few truly distributed storage systems are available today. And the existing ones focus on 1 use case: small files versus big, data base records, volumes, ...

Often, the distributed storage systems are slow, complex, don't have a unified namespace, are hard to use in a cloud context and have a TCO that remains quite high.

The storage buckets are used with an intuitive REST API.
