h2. Desktop Buckets

h3. Description

VDI (Virtual Disk Image) is the practice of hosting a desktop operating system within a virtual machine (VM) running on a hosted, centralized or remote server. Microsoft developed a technology called virtual desktop infrastructure in Windows Server 2008.

The issue when using a VDI is that only the desktop is moved into the cloud and no solution is provided for more optimal desktop management, desktop mobility and use on multiple devices. Also it lacks on cloud storage including collaboration features and sharing functions.

Desktop buckets bring an innovative new way to deliver end user IT. Create a collaboration space where each user has a unified all in one cloud application portal to manage applications and data across all devices!

Desktop Buckets uses a single sign on portal that lists the users' applications and connects them transparently to the selected apps. Users can use any device with a browser that supports html5. That is the case for all modern browsers and most smart devices like smartphones and tablets.

Desktop Buckets bring a significant change in:
* Desktop management: provisioning, updates, support is many more times easy and less costly
* True device agnostic: it does not matter what device you use, even you can bring your own
* Use of known native apps and not saas lookalike apps
* Full private and secure storage cloud
* Collaboration with other workers
* Support of legacy applications
